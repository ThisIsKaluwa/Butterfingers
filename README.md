# Butterfingers
A Leap Motion Project

Butterfingers is an interactive Game that uses the Leap Motion as a controller.

## How it works
The game consists of 10 levels with a countdown timer of 2 minutes each. 
Complete the orders shown at the wall in front of you in time with the ingedients given to you. \
Every level you get a score based on your time and a total score at the end. \
Compete with your friends, be quick and most importantly - don't have **butterfingers**!
